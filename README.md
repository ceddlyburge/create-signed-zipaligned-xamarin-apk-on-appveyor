# Create Signed Zipaligned Xamarin APK on AppVeyor

This is a repository that I created whilst writing a [blog post about Creating a APK on AppVeyor via Xamarin](https://www.appveyor.com/blog/2016/11/22/create-signed-aligned-xamarin-apk/). 

If you have problems following the instructions in the post, then this working, from scratch example will help you.
